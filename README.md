# What Is Regression?

Regression is a statistical tool used to comprehend and model the relationships between variables. Its primary purpose is forecasting the values of a dependent variable by leveraging the values of one or more independent variables. Regression analysis aims to elucidate the data and account for the variance in the dependent variable through the fluctuations in the independent variables.

There are multiple types of regression but we will only discuss 2 types. The Linear rRegression and Logistitic Regression.

There are 2 types of Linear Regression, Simple Linear and Multiple Linear Regression.

# Simple Linear Regression
- involves a single independent variable to predict a dependent variable. It models the relationship between the two variables as a straight line (linearly).

# Multiple linear regression 
- involves two or more independent variables to predict a dependent variable. It still assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable.
