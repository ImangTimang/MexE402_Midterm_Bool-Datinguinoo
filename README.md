# What Is Regression?

Regression is a statistical tool used to comprehend and model the relationships between variables. Its primary purpose is forecasting the values of a dependent variable by leveraging the values of one or more independent variables. Regression analysis aims to elucidate the data and account for the variance in the dependent variable through the fluctuations in the independent variables.

There are 2 types of Linear Regression, Simple Linear and Multiple Linear Regression.

# Simple Linear Regression
- involves a single independent variable to predict a dependent variable. It models the relationship between the two variables as a straight line (linearly).

# Multiple Linear Regression 
- involves two or more independent variables to predict a dependent variable. It still assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable.

# Logistic Regression
- used for binary classification problems (where the output is binary). It models the probability of the default class (success or failure).
